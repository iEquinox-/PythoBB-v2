# PythoBB-v2
The second official version of PythoBB, better in all aspects.
# Balanced
PythoBB version 2.0.0 (PythoBBv2 for short) utilizes JavaScript to handle light-weight and trivial processes, such as setting cookies or send alerts to the user. It is also used for responsive and dynamic page elements, as well as streaming data from Python sent in the JSON format, all so you don't have to. Noticed how we mentioned JSON? That's right, PythoBB now uses JSON, as opposed to normally sending GET and POST requests, jQuery sends the request for dynamic responses, instead of having to load the same page just to find an error. PythoBB brings more functionality to the table, not just with JavaScript. Special modules have been made to handle data, security, and page rendering, as opposed to have a single module working hard just to process a single request. Not only that, but PythoBB also renders static files, as opposed to have the files be hosted on another server, or having to hard code it either into the page, or modifying the original code.
# What's New?
Well, a lot of things. A new table schema, easier modification to the forum settings, but what's new and what's better isn't what matters. What's to come is what really matters. An alert system (i.e. other users responding to your posts), theme implementation, so you don't have to modify the files of the software, and plugin system
# When will it be done?
I can't put a finite date and time in place, however, I can say that it will probably be finished sometime this weekend (3/6/15 - 3/8/15), so look forward!
